# 🌐 Web Development

Welcome to my **Front-End Web Development** repository! This space is dedicated to my learning journey as I explore the fundamentals of building beautiful and responsive user interfaces for the web.

## 📌 Current Focus
I’m currently learning and practicing the core building blocks of front-end development:

- **HTML** – Structure and semantics of web pages  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout fundamentals  
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity and dynamic content  

You’ll find practice projects, mini UI components, and experimental code as I sharpen my front-end skills.

## 🔧 Tools & Frameworks (Coming Soon)
As I advance, I plan to include modern tools and frameworks such as:

- **React.js** – Component-based front-end library  
- **Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap** – Utility-first and responsive UI design  

These tools will help me build scalable, maintainable, and visually appealing front-end applications.

## 📚 Learning Resources
I’m learning from:

- [Dave Gray on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode)  
- [Apna College on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ApnaCollegeOfficial)  

Their tutorials have been instrumental in helping me understand web development in a clear and beginner-friendly way.

## 💡 Purpose of This Repository
- Document my progress  
- Host and share my projects  
- Practice and refine my coding skills  
- Track my growth from beginner to advanced front-end developer  

This repository will evolve over time as I gain confidence and move on to more advanced projects and technologies.
